# Simon-Game
The game features a title prompting players to press a key to start. It includes a container with four colored buttons: green, red, yellow, and blue, organized into two rows. Each button is styled with CSS classes for visual appeal, and the Google font "Press Start 2P" is used for a retro look. jQuery is included for interactive functionality, while a separate JavaScript file, "game.js," is linked to manage game logic. Overall, the code sets up the game's layout and prepares for interactive gameplay.
